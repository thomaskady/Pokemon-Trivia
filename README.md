# Pokemon-Trivia

This is a project I am working on to log and practice my progress in self-teaching HTML, CSS, and Javascript. There have been a ton of new Pokemon since the franchise first started. This web app aims to introduce fans of Pokemon to the types and names of the newer Pokemon through an interactive game process. The app pulls assets from pokeapi.co.
