                Welcome, trainer! We have created this simulated environment to
                teach you about type advantages and Pokemon species before you
                embark on your own journey. There are hundreds of species to
                memorize, with a wide variety of typings and traits to
                understand.
            </p>
            <p class="hidden animate invisible" id="text__2">
                To catch more Pokemon, you must fulfill two requirements. First,
                you must send out a Pokemon that has a type advantage over the
                wild Pokemon. Second, you must be able to identify the Pokemon
                species. Unfortunately your Pokedex can only provide a scrambled
                version of the species name until you capture it. Correctly
                unscramble the name to complete the capture. Once you have
                captured the Pokemon, it will be stored in your PC and you may
                use it in future battles.
            </p>
            <p class="hidden animate invisible" id="text__3">
                To begin, I have provided you with 3 of your very own
                representative Pokemon. Below, you will find the Grass Pokemon
                BULBASAUR, the Fire Pokemon CHARMANDER, and the Water Pokemon
                SQUIRTLE. If you forget their typings, you can always check your
                Pokedex.
            </p>
            <p class="hidden animate invisible" id="text__4">
                These Pokemon will not provide the type coverage you need for
                every encounter. Part of being a good trainer is knowing what
                fights you can take. If you do not have a Pokemon representative
                available to you that can inflict a super effective attack, you
                will have to flee. As you capture more Pokemon, you will be able
                to inflict more super effective attacks and capture more
                Pokemon.
            </p>
            <p class="hidden animate invisible" id="text__5">
                It's time for you to encounter some Pokemon. You will find that
                some species are more common than others, so don't get
                discouraged if it takes some time to complete your Pokedex.
                Whenever you're ready, click "Next Encounter" below.
