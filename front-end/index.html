                Welcome, trainer! We have created this simulated environment to
                teach you about type advantages and Pokemon species before you
                embark on your own journey. There are hundreds of species to
                memorize, with a wide variety of typings and traits to
                understand.
            </p>
            <p class="hidden animate invisible" id="text__2">
                To catch more Pokemon, you must fulfill two requirements. First,
                you must send out a Pokemon that has a type advantage over the
                wild Pokemon. Second, you must be able to identify the Pokemon
                species. Unfortunately your Pokedex can only provide a scrambled
                version of the species name until you capture it. Correctly
                unscramble the name to complete the capture. Once you have
                captured the Pokemon, it will be stored in your PC and you may
                use it in future battles.
            </p>
            <p class="hidden animate invisible" id="text__3">
                To begin, I have provided you with 3 of your very own Pokemon.
                Below, you will find the Grass Pokemon BULBASAUR, the Fire
                Pokemon CHARMANDER, and the Water Pokemon SQUIRTLE. If you
                forget their typings, you can always check your Pokedex.
            </p>
            <p class="hidden animate invisible" id="text__4">
                It's time for you to encounter some Pokemon. You will find
                that some species are more common than others, so don't get
                discouraged if it takes some time to complete your Pokedex.
                Whenever you're ready, click "Next Encounter" below.
